Pros: Ai has plenty of things that help us for example: gaming studios needing an ai system to help run their world and test it and make sure it can detect cheaters, Google, VPNs, Grammerly, Instant communication, etc.
It has many benefits and is a stronghold in our world, however..
Cons:There are many big companies and cyber criminals that steal and trade your data and informination without your consent, plus malware, scams, spam emails, viruses etc. 
There is no shortages of bad things that come with ai and I wouldn't blame people for thinking ai is a double edged sword, because that's what I believe it truly comes down to the person or people using it. 
It became a tool of destuction or a haven for us.
